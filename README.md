The Collatz conjecture, formulated by German mathematician Lothar Collatz in 1937, is one of the most intriguing unsolved problems in mathematics. It posits a deceptively simple sequence transformation: start with any positive integer n. If n is even, divide it by 2; if it's odd, triple it and add 1. Repeat this process, and the conjecture suggests that no matter what initial number you choose, you'll eventually reach the cycle 4, 2, 1, which loops infinitely. Despite decades of exploration and computer verification for vast numbers, a proof for all integers still eludes mathematicians. Its simplicity masks its complexity, making it a fascinating puzzle that continues to captivate mathematicians and amateurs alike.
